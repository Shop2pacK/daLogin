# daLogin

MySQL 8.0.30 </br>
 </br>
 </br>
 
# Adressed Issues so far </br>

- Not using AJAX for timeout anymore </br>
- Session expiration moved to server side </br>
- Not using alt attribute on decorative images </br>
- Added "create schema/database" to tables.sql </br>
- session.cookie_lifetime and session.gc_maxlifetime added to php.ini </br>
- more settings added to php.ini to help with mitigating attacks
- html lang="pt-br" </br>
- optional ?> - Coming from a non programming bkgrnd I fell like I need to have it. </br>
- Validation Class
- Signup now have a loop that goes through an array of errors, if any, and show them </br>
 </br>

# PDO vs MySQLi </br>
 </br>
I'm gonna stick with MySQLi for now. </br>
Like I said, this is my very first PHP adventure and  </br>
I will leave object oriented programming for future endeavours. </br>
I like the try catch approach better but, procedural seems to be  </br>
a quicker path to get things done at this beggining. </br>
Coming from a NoSQL and Oracle database background, PDO looks great, but not now. </br>

# About the JS used to mask brazilian phone number </br>
 </br>
If not guided, brazilian end users can type all sort of wrong and fake phone numbers. </br>
Since those numbers are going to be used as unique keys in the future,  </br>
that was the best solution I could find. </br>
Tried to use html patterns with no luck so went back to js
 </br>
 </br>
 
# CSS and Bootstrap </br>
 </br>
Floating labels must be used as per customer's request. </br>
It is a personal preference to use Bootstrap or not. </br>
So, I'll keep using it. </br>
Of course I could create my own CSS but 
I prefer to spend time on business logic than curb side appeal. </br>
 </br>
 </br>
 
# English and Brazilian Portuguese languages </br>
 </br>
Front end and enduser spoken language should match. </br>
 </br>
 </br>

# Work in Progress </br>
 </br>
PDO and User Class </br>
 </br>
 </br>
